comment = "Overall, good effort in writing this summary. You have clearly highlighted both opinions about living in the outskirts versus the country, which shows you understood the passage. I noticed some great vocabulary, such as 'transportation' and 'expensive,' which is excellent. However, there are some areas where improvement is needed. For example, the spelling of 'whether' instead of 'wheter,' and 'writer' instead of 'writter.' Also, it's important to use proper grammar, like 'city is better than countryside' instead of 'city is better then countryside.' Try to be consistent with verb forms and spellings to make your writing clear. Keep practicing, and you will see improvement!"
